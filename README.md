SOTag
=====

Tagging system based on StackOverflows tags with descriptions.

I found myself in need of a tagging system, so I searched far and wide on the internet for a decent one, and I couldn't find one! The style I was going for was the tagging system used on StackOverflow (hence the name SOTag). And searching StackOverflow there are hundreds of questions asking for tagging systems like it!

So I created SOTag, a simple tagging system that only allows a set of tags hat are stored in a database.
